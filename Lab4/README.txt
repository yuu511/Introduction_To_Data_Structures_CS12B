CharType.c uses code from lab3, fileio.c to read an input file and write output onto another file.
To read the file line by line, the program uses a while loop in conjunction with fgets().
The main program parses alphabetic, numeric, punctuation and whitespace characters with functions from the 
ctype.h library.

Note: I was unable to format the program in the specified way: void extract_chars(char* s, char* a, char* d, char* p, char* w),
but the output should be correct.
