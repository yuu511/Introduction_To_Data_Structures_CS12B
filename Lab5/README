Dictionary.c uses the Linked List ADT to store int values.
It has  basic find, delete, and insert functions, along with functions that free memory.
I parsed input using fgets to get lines in a file, and sscanf to parse the lines.
Make will compile and create an executable given the approprate files given the correct 
Dictionary.h file is in the same repositiory.
Make check runs valgrind,and assumes that input file name is in, and output file name is out.
